# Project 2: Fake News Detector 
![Fake News](README2img/fakeimg.jpg)
## Overview
The Fake News Detector is a machine learning project using Natural Language Processing (NLP). This AI model classifies news articles as either True or Fake. By leveraging a robust pipeline and comparing various machine learning models, the best-performing model is selected to ensure high accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Features
### Model Benchmarking
Multiple machine learning models were tested and compared to identify the most effective solution:

üìä Naive Bayes

üå≥ Random Forest

üìà Logistic Regression

üíª Passive-Aggressive Classifier

‚öôÔ∏è Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Best Model

### Hyperparameter Tuning

While advanced hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search and Random Search were explored, they proved computationally expensive with marginal benefits. A basic SVM configuration was retained for optimal performance.

### NLP Pipeline

The system implements a comprehensive NLP pipeline to preprocess and analyze text:

* Text Cleaning

* Tokenization

* TF-IDF Vectorization

## üîç Limitations & Future Improvements

### Computational Efficiency

Advanced hyperparameter tuning like Grid Search and Random Search was computationally expensive and yielded negligible improvements.
Future efforts could leverage cloud-based or distributed computing for such tasks.

### Advanced Models

Incorporating deep learning architectures like Transformers (e.g., BERT) could further enhance accuracy and generalizability.

### Dataset Diversity

Expanding the dataset to include more diverse and global sources would improve the model's robustness and applicability.
